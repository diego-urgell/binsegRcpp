2021.3.8

Modified the package to compute changes in mean and variance instead of only mean.
(By Diego Urgell)

2021.1.6

More comments in binseg_normal.cpp to help potential GSOC students.

2020.10.7

Comment binseg_normal.cpp to explain optimal_cost computation.

Use C++ multiset with operator< instead of multimap/vector.

Use cumsum C++ vector for constant time mean/cost computation for any
split.

Store cost of segments before/after split, pass the cost values to
maybe_add to avoid having to recompute them.

Computation works for only one data point.

2020.9.15

remove unused C++ errors.

test coef method.

2020.9.3

Bugfix for negative means, docs.

predict/plot methods, copy code from example.

2019.9.20

Initial implementation.
